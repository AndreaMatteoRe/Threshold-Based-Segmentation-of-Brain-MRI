THRESHOLD-BASED SEGMENTATION AND PROCESSING OF BRAIN MRI IMAGES
-----
This folder contains all the files related to the project on the segmentation and processing of brain MRI images using threshold-based techniques.
-----

File structure:

1. BraTS20_Training_012_t1.nii → the T1-weighted brain MRI image from the BraTS 2020 dataset used as input for the threshold-based segmentation and processing experiments.
 --> Here you can find the dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation

2. BrainMRI_code.ipynb → the Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the threshold-based segmentation pipeline, including preprocessing, thresholding methods, post-processing, and result visualization for brain MRI images.

3. Threshold-Based-Segmentation-of-Brain-MRI-report.pdf → the final written report describing the theoretical background, methodology, experimental analysis, results, and conclusions of the threshold-based brain MRI segmentation project.

4. Threshold-Based-Segmentation-of-Brain-MRI.pptx → the PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project objectives, methodology, segmentation techniques, experimental results, and conclusions on brain MRI image processing.

HOW TO USE THE PROJECT

1) Load BraTS20_Training_012_t1.nii and select the slice to be analyzed.

2) Execute BrainMRI_code.ipynb to perform preprocessing, apply threshold-based segmentation techniques, and visualize the results.

3) Review Threshold-Based-Segmentation-of-Brain-MRI-report.pdf for a detailed description of the theoretical background, methodology, experimental analysis, and results.

4) Consult Threshold-Based-Segmentation-of-Brain-MRI.pptx for a concise summary of the project objectives, methods, and main conclusions.
